💡 Business Recommendations

📍 1. Improve Delivery Time in Slow Cities

Hyderabad, Pune, and Mumbai need operational improvements to reduce delays.

Suggestion: Better batching, improved routing, and timing-based surge handling.

📍 2. Strengthen Retention Strategy

Since repeat customers contribute ~50% of orders, a loyalty program can significantly increase order frequency.

Eg: Free delivery after 5 orders, points system, personalized cuisine recommendations.

📍 3. Focus Marketing on High-Demand Cuisines

Fast Food & North Indian cuisine segments can be promoted further with combo offers.

Low-demand cuisines can be bundled during off-peak hours.

📍 4. Reduce Cancellations with Better ETA Predictions

Slight improvement in expected delivery times can directly reduce cancellations.

ML-based ETA refinement can help.

📍 5. Convert “Potential Loyalists” Into Repeat Buyers

Push targeted offers to customers showing increasing frequency but still low recency.

Personalized notifications → “Order again from your favorite restaurant!”
